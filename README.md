## How this project was built

From the AI-generated HTML and CSS drafts,
I wrote the specs and JS within Copilot's two-line limit.
Afterward, I made some fixes using AI bug checking and auditing.
Every line was **reviewed, tested, and either kept with confidence or rewritten/deleted by me**  
  → The final code contains only what I'm confident in and take responsibility for
