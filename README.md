## How this project was built

From the AI-generated HTML and CSS drafts,
I wrote the specs and JS within Copilot's two-line limit.
Afterward, I made some fixes using AI bug checking and auditing.

## Overview

- Lightweight single-file countdown timer.
- Default work time is 25 minutes (1500 seconds). Basic controls: Start / Stop / Reset.

## Features

- Start: begin the countdown when the button is pressed.
- Stop: pause the countdown and retain the remaining time.
- Reset: restore the remaining time to 25:00.
- End notification: an alert is shown when the timer reaches 00:00.
